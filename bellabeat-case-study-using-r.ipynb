to reduce certain amount of calories everyday.This would motivate users to burn that amount of calories\n* The company should target more women who spend their time being inactive(working infront of computer,being at home,etc).They should be their target audience since they are susceptible for bad health conditions.\n* The total number of steps taken on an average is around 6000 which is fairly low and the recommended target is 10000 steps a day.The app could provide points everyday to achieve those steps.\n* The app could come with campaign for more users to use the device and also share their data for analysis.They could spread   awareness about benefits of leading a healthy life style and how some activities which we consider normal(sitting for longer time) might actual be the key reason for poor health.\n* The app could also set up milestones for once in 3 months or 6 months or so for the user.They could use those points to claim some price.\n","metadata":{}}]}
